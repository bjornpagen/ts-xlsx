/**
 * The only module in this repo that imports `node:sqlite`.
 *
 * That confinement is deliberate and cheap insurance: the API is flagged
 * experimental and documented as free to change, so a break costs one file
 * rather than a rewrite. Everything above this module deals in plain objects.
 *
 * The database sits next to this file (`./data/ooxml.db`), resolved through
 * `import.meta.url` rather than `process.cwd()`. That is what makes the
 * vendoring scheme work unchanged in three places: `core/`, `skill/scripts/`
 * and `mcp/src/` each carry their own copy beside their own copy of this
 * module, and none of them cares where the process was started from.
